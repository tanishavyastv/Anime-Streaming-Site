                Anime, style of animation popular in Japanese films. Early anime films were intended primarily for the
                Japanese market and, as such, employed many cultural references unique to Japan. For example, the large
                eyes of anime characters are commonly perceived in Japan as multifaceted “windows to the soul.” Much of
                the genre is aimed at children, but anime films are sometimes marked by adult themes and subject matter.
                Modern anime began in 1956 and found lasting success in 1961 with the establishment of Mushi Productions
                by Osamu Tezuka, a leading figure in modern manga, the dense, novelistic Japanese comic book style that
                contributed greatly to the aesthetic of anime. Anime such as Miyazaki Hayao's Princess Mononoke (1997)
                are the modern equivalent of the epic folk adventures once filmed by Japanese masters such as Mizoguchi
                Kenji and Kurosawa Akira. At the turn of the 21st century, anime began to attain wide international
                popularity with the Pokémon television series and films such as Miyazaki's Spirited Away (2002), winner
                of an Academy Award for best animated feature film.
