                        Anime, style of animation popular in Japanese films. Early anime films were intended primarily
                        for the Japanese market and, as such, employed many cultural references unique to Japan. For
                        example, the large eyes of anime characters are commonly perceived in Japan as multifaceted
                        “windows to the
                        soul.” Much of the genre is aimed at children, but anime films are sometimes marked by adult
                        themes and
                        subject matter. Modern anime began in 1956 and found lasting success in 1961 with the
                        establishment of
                        Mushi Productions by Osamu Tezuka, a leading figure in modern manga, the dense, novelistic
                        Japanese
                        comic book style that contributed greatly to the aesthetic of anime. Anime such as Miyazaki
                        Hayao's Princess
                        Mononoke (1997) are the modern equivalent of the epic folk adventures once filmed by Japanese
                        masters
                        such as Mizoguchi Kenji and Kurosawa Akira. At the turn of the 21st century, anime began to
                        attain wide
                        international popularity with the Pokémon television series and films such as Miyazaki's
                        Spirited Away (2002),
                        winner of an Academy Award for best animated feature film.
